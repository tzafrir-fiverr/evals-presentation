# Slide 14: Speaker Notes

## TLDR
- Reinforce transformation from art to engineering
- Emphasize concrete improvements achieved
- Call to action: start evaluating today

## In-Depth Knowledge

### The Transformation

**Before Evaluations**:
- Prompt engineering felt like guesswork
- Changes based on intuition
- No way to measure improvement
- Fear of breaking existing functionality

**After Evaluations**:
- Data-driven decisions
- Measurable improvements
- Confidence in changes
- Systematic progress

**Cultural Shift**:
- Engineers expect tests for code
- Now expecting tests for prompts
- Quality bar raised across industry
- Evaluation becoming standard practice

### Level Selection Wisdom

**Decision Framework**:
```python
def choose_evaluation_level(task):
    if task.has_fixed_output_format():
        return "exact_match"  # Level 1
    elif task.needs_quality_assessment():
        return "model_as_judge"  # Level 2
    elif task.requires_execution():
        return "custom_python"  # Level 3
    else:
        return "start_with_exact_match"
```

**Evolution Pattern**:
- 90% start with Level 1
- 50% eventually need Level 2
- 10% require Level 3
- All benefit from systematic approach

### Success Metrics

**Typical Improvement Curves**:
1. **Week 1**: 40% → 70% (low-hanging fruit)
2. **Week 2**: 70% → 85% (refinement)
3. **Week 3**: 85% → 90%+ (edge cases)
4. **Plateau**: Indicates fundamental limits

**ROI Calculation**:
```python
# Simple ROI model
development_hours = 20
hourly_rate = 150
development_cost = development_hours * hourly_rate  # $3,000

# Benefits
error_reduction = 0.5  # 50% fewer errors
errors_per_day = 100
cost_per_error = 5  # Support time, user impact
daily_savings = errors_per_day * error_reduction * cost_per_error
monthly_savings = daily_savings * 30  # $7,500

roi_months = development_cost / monthly_savings  # 0.4 months
```

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**:
- Install OpenAI SDK
- Run first example
- Understand the API

**Week 1**:
- Create first real eval
- Test existing prompts
- Find improvement opportunities

**Month 1**:
- 3-5 evaluations running
- Team adopting process
- Measurable improvements

**Quarter 1**:
- Evaluation-first culture
- Automated pipelines
- Production monitoring

### Common Success Patterns

**Pattern 1: Format First**
- Fix output format issues
- Usually 20-30% improvement
- Enables downstream processing

**Pattern 2: Edge Case Discovery**
- Find failure modes in production
- Add to test suite
- Prevent regressions

**Pattern 3: Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with basics
- Add complexity gradually
- Stop at good enough

### Addressing Concerns

**"It's Too Complex"**:
- Start with 10 lines of code
- Use existing examples
- Complexity comes later

**"It's Too Expensive"**:
- $0.03 per 100 tests with gpt-4o-mini
- Compare to production failures
- ROI usually < 1 month

**"We Don't Have Time"**:
- 2 hours initial setup
- 15 minutes per iteration
- Time saved in debugging

### The Liability Statement

**Why "Every production prompt without evaluation is a liability"**:

1. **Unknown Failure Modes**: Can't fix what you can't measure
2. **Regression Risk**: Changes break existing functionality
3. **Compliance Issues**: Can't prove safety/accuracy
4. **Technical Debt**: Accumulates with each change
5. **User Trust**: One bad experience damages reputation

### Final Thoughts

**The Future**:
- Evaluation will be standard practice
- Tools will continue improving
- Early adopters have advantage
- Skills transfer across projects

**Personal Growth**:
- Systematic thinking
- Data-driven decisions
- Engineering rigor
- Measurable impact

**Team Benefits**:
- Shared quality standards
- Objective discussions
- Faster onboarding
- Better collaboration

### Call to Action

**This Week**:
1. Choose one prompt in production
2. Create 20 test cases
3. Run evaluation
4. Make one improvement
5. Share results with team

**This Month**:
1. Evaluate all critical prompts
2. Establish team standards
3. Automate the process
4. Track improvements

**This Quarter**:
1. Build evaluation culture
2. Create knowledge base
3. Reduce production issues
4. Demonstrate ROI

Remember: The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.

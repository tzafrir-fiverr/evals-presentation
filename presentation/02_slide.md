# The Problem: Vibes-Based Development Doesn't Scale

## Current Reality
- "This prompt seems better" ❌
- Testing on 3-5 examples ❌  
- No regression detection ❌
- Production surprises ❌

## What We Need
- Quantifiable improvements ✅
- Testing on 100s of examples ✅
- Automated regression testing ✅
- Predictable production behavior ✅

## The Cost of Getting It Wrong
- **Large Scale Apps**: Millions of users affected by prompt failures
- **Financial Impact**: Majority of AI projects fail without proper evaluation
- **Your App**: Every prompt change is a production risk

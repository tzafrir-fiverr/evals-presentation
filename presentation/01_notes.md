# Slide 1: Speaker Notes

## TLDR
- Evaluations transform prompt engineering from art to science
- OpenAI Evals API enables systematic testing at scale
- Focus on practical implementation, not theory

## In-Depth Knowledge

### Background Context
The OpenAI Evals API was released in 2024 as a response to the growing need for systematic LLM testing. It provides programmatic access to create, run, and analyze evaluations directly through the API, eliminating the need for complex frameworks or manual testing.

### Key Technical Points

1. **The Evolution**: OpenAI moved from open-source evals framework (github.com/openai/evals) to a hosted API solution, making it more accessible and integrated with their platform.

2. **API Architecture**: The Evals API follows a two-step process:
   - Create an evaluation configuration (defines what to test)
   - Run the evaluation on specific models with test data

3. **Why It Matters**: 
   - Systematic testing can improve success rates dramatically
   - Production reliability requires rigorous evaluation
   - Quantifiable improvements replace guesswork

### Technical Capabilities
- Supports multiple grader types: string matching, model-based evaluation, custom logic
- Integrates with existing OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- Provides detailed metrics: accuracy, token usage, latency
- Real-time result streaming and batch processing

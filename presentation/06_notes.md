# Slide 6: Speaker Notes

## TLDR
- Model-as-judge enables sophisticated evaluation of nuanced outputs that exact matching cannot handle
- Latest models (GPT-4, o1, o3-mini, o4-mini) offer different cost/performance tradeoffs for evaluation tasks
- Proper rubric engineering, bias mitigation, and reliability calibration are critical for production deployment
- 2025 pricing: GPT-4o ($5/$20 per 1M tokens), GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/$0.60), with o3/o4 models offering specialized capabilities

## Why Model-as-Judge is Needed

### Beyond Exact Matching
1. **Context-Dependent Evaluation**:
   - "How to kill a process" (programming) vs threats
   - "Injection techniques" (medical) vs hacking
   - "Market manipulation" (education) vs illegal activity
   - Medical advice requiring nuanced safety assessment
   - Customer service requiring tone and empathy evaluation

2. **Limitations of Traditional Metrics**:
   - BLEU/ROUGE fail to capture semantic meaning
   - Exact match misses paraphrasing and synonyms
   - Binary decisions provide no partial credit
   - Cannot evaluate creativity, appropriateness, or safety
   - Miss critical edge cases in production systems

3. **Scalability Requirements**:
   - Human evaluation is expensive ($50-100/hour)
   - LLM judges can process 1000s of examples per minute
   - Consistent application of complex rubrics
   - 24/7 availability for real-time systems

## Rubric Design Engineering

### Core Design Patterns
1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**:
   ```python
   rubric = """
   Evaluate the customer service response following these steps:
   1. First, identify the customer's core issue
   2. Check if the response addresses this issue
   3. Evaluate the tone (professional, empathetic)
   4. Look for policy compliance
   5. Provide a score 1-5 with reasoning
   """
   ```

2. **Structured Rubric Templates**:
   ```json
   {
     "criteria": {
       "relevance": {
         "weight": 0.3,
         "levels": {
           "5": "Directly addresses all customer concerns",
           "3": "Addresses main concern but misses details",
           "1": "Off-topic or irrelevant response"
         }
       },
       "tone": {
         "weight": 0.2,
         "levels": {
           "5": "Warm, professional, and empathetic",
           "3": "Professional but somewhat cold",
           "1": "Rude, dismissive, or inappropriate"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Few-Shot Examples in Rubrics**:
   - Include 3-5 examples per score level
   - Cover edge cases and common mistakes
   - Show reasoning for each example score
   - Update examples based on production failures

### Advanced Rubric Techniques
1. **Hierarchical Evaluation**:
   - First assess if response is safe/appropriate
   - Then evaluate quality dimensions
   - Finally score specific criteria

2. **Dynamic Rubric Adaptation**:
   - Adjust rubric based on context (B2B vs B2C)
   - Different criteria for different user segments
   - Severity-based evaluation thresholds

3. **Multi-Perspective Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate from user perspective
   - Check business/policy compliance
   - Consider legal/ethical dimensions

### Model Selection Framework
```python
def select_judge_model(task_complexity, volume, latency_requirement):
    if task_complexity == "high" and volume < 1000:
        return "gpt-4o"  # Quality over cost
    elif latency_requirement < 1000:  # milliseconds
        return "o4-mini"  # Speed critical
    elif "code" in task_type:
        return "o3-mini"  # Specialized capability
    else:
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  # Cost-effective default
```

## Inter-Rater Reliability & Calibration

### Reliability Metrics
1. **Human-AI Agreement**:
   - GPT-4 achieves 0.67-0.81 Spearman correlation with humans
   - Higher than inter-human agreement (0.54-0.75) in some domains
   - G-Eval shows superior Kendall-Tau correlation

2. **Calibration Techniques**:
   - **Initial Calibration**: 100-200 human-labeled examples
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Track agreement metrics
   - **Criteria Drift Detection**: Monitor when new patterns emerge
   - **Disagreement Analysis**: Focus improvements on edge cases

3. **Validation Workflow** (Shankar et al., 2024):
   ```
   1. Prototype evaluation prompts
   2. Test on golden dataset (human-labeled)
   3. Analyze disagreements
   4. Refine rubric and examples
   5. Re-validate until threshold met (>0.8 correlation)
   ```

## Bias Mitigation Strategies

### Known Biases in LLM Judges
1. **Position Bias**: Preference for first/last options
2. **Length Bias**: Favoring longer responses
3. **Style Bias**: Preferring certain writing styles
4. **Self-Preference**: Models favor their own outputs

### Mitigation Techniques
1. **Swap Augmentation**:
   ```python
   # Evaluate both orders and average
   score_A_first = evaluate(option_A, option_B)
   score_B_first = evaluate(option_B, option_A)
   final_score = (score_A_first + (1 - score_B_first)) / 2
   ```

2. **Reference Support/Drop**:
   - Sometimes include reference answers
   - Sometimes exclude to test robustness
   - Helps identify over-reliance on references

3. **Blind Evaluation**:
   - Remove model identifiers
   - Anonymize writing style cues
   - Randomize presentation order

4. **Multi-Model Consensus**:
   - Use 3+ different models as judges
   - Require majority agreement
   - Flag high-variance cases for human review

5. **Demographic Debiasing**:
   - Test for biases across protected categories
   - Use counterfactual prompts
   - Apply fairness metrics (demographic parity)

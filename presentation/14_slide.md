# Key Takeaways

## 1. Evaluations Transform Development
- From "seems better" → "15% improvement"
- From hope → confidence
- From art → engineering

## 2. Three Levels for Different Needs
- **Exact Match**: Fast, deterministic classification
- **Model-as-Judge**: Flexible quality assessment
- **Custom Python**: Complex validation logic

## 3. Start Simple, Evolve Systematically
- 20 test cases is enough to start
- Each iteration reveals specific issues
- Version everything

## 4. Real Results from This Approach
- News categorization: 42% → 95%
- Content moderation: 78% → 94%
- Function generation: 45% → 89%

## 5. It's Easier Than You Think
- 2 hours to set up first eval
- 15 minutes per iteration
- ROI visible immediately

## Your Next Action

```python
# Start now:
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

# Create your first eval today
# Run it on your current prompt
# Improve based on results
# Ship with confidence
```

**Remember**: Every production prompt without evaluation is a liability

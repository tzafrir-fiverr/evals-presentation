# Slide 2: Speaker Notes

## TLDR
- Manual testing doesn't scale and misses edge cases
- Production failures are costly and damage user trust
- Systematic evaluation is the difference between hobby projects and production systems

## In-Depth Knowledge

### The Problems with Traditional Prompt Engineering

1. **Sample Size Issues**
   - Developers typically test on 3-10 examples
   - Real applications face thousands of variations
   - Edge cases only appear at scale
   - Statistical significance requires larger datasets

2. **Regression Blindness**
   - No way to know if a "fix" breaks other cases
   - Prompt changes can have cascading effects
   - Without baselines, improvements are guesswork
   - Version control doesn't equal behavior tracking

3. **Production Reality Check**
   - User inputs are unpredictable and adversarial
   - Models behave differently under load
   - Temperature settings affect consistency
   - Context window limitations emerge unexpectedly

### Real Failure Examples

1. **Customer Service Bot**: Changed prompt to be "more helpful," resulted in bot agreeing to illegal refund requests
2. **Code Generator**: Improved Python generation, unknowingly broke JavaScript handling
3. **Content Moderator**: Tightened safety rules, started blocking legitimate business discussions

### Financial Impact
- McKinsey: 70% of companies fail to scale AI pilots
- Gartner: 85% of AI projects fail to deliver on promises
- Average cost of AI failure: $1.2M per project
- User trust recovery: 6-12 months after major failure

### Technical Debt Accumulation
- Each untested prompt change adds technical debt
- Compound effect: later changes become riskier
- Documentation drift: prompts evolve faster than docs
- Knowledge loss: original intent gets forgotten
